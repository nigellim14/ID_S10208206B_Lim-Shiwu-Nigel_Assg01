A personal portfolio of myself with design and develop responsive website

index page (index.html): This is my Homepage introducing myself with the basic personal information and contact information for recruiters.

(1) I have used "Nav" function bar having it easy to use navigating between the different pages in the website.
(2) I have used "JavaScript" date object to display the time zone and display a date above my header title.
(3) Making used of the "Image Text Container" function where I display a wide cover picture with a main title text of what the page consist of.
(4) For the information on [Ways to contact, About me, My accomplisment] I have created a "Column" function to store and display a 3-column layout grid.
(5) "My Accomplisment" I managed to use a "Ordered Lists" function to define a ordered list with numerical or it could even be a alphabetical.
(6) In each of the Column in [Ways to contact me],[About me] I have added a "a href" attributes to specifes the link of the destination that I would like it to link to.
(7) I used "footer" at the end of my page as it is use typically containing my contact information and related documents for recruiters to view.
