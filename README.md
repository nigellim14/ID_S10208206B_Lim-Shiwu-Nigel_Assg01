For the information on [Ways to contact, About me, My accomplisment] I have created a "Column" function to store and display a 3-column layout grid. "My Accomplisment" I managed to use a "Ordered Lists" function to define a ordered list with numerical or it could even be a alphabetical. For each of the Column in [Ways to contact me],[About me] I have added a "a href" attributes to specifes the link of the destination that I would like it to link to.

Created a "row" function of 2 column, starting of from the left is a images on the right it's the textbox for recruiters to fill up. By using "form" function where I will have "input type" placeholder for text, email, comment. Created form "validation" function that is done in javascript, it will be called to check if a form field is empty if it is the function will alert a message and return false. This will result in preventing the form to be submitted out. Having the data validation it is a process of ensuring that recreuiters input are correct, clean, useful. Added a "input type" Email me and reset, email me it will eventually send the email out and for the reset it will then reset the placeholder and allow user to retype their information into it. At the end of the form I have a "p" to thank the recruiters for reaching out to my website and taking the time to go through my website.
